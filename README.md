# n8n automation

## Objective

To build automated security workflows integrated with the NixGuard API to streamline detection, alerting, and response actions in a SOC environment. The goal was to reduce manual analyst workload by automating repetitive security operations such as log ingestion, threat identification, and incident notification.

## Skills Learned

- ðŸ”„ Workflow Design: Created multi-step, event-driven workflows to automate the collection, analysis, and response to security events using visual flow logic.
- ðŸ”— API Integration: Connected n8n to the NixGuard API using HTTP Request nodes, passing dynamic parameters and handling authentication securely.
- ðŸ“¡ Threat Intelligence Automation: Automated threat lookups, IP analysis, and alerting processes for real-time security monitoring and response.
- ðŸ”” Automated Notifications: Integrated conditional logic and trigger nodes to send alerts (e.g., via email or webhook) when specific threats or anomalies were detected.
- ðŸ§ª Testing & Debugging: Tested and optimized each step of the workflow to ensure data integrity, correct parsing of API responses, and efficient error handling.

## Tools Used
- n8n â€“ Low-code workflow automation platform used to build and orchestrate automated threat response workflows.

## Steps

Built the following workflow to automate log analysis and fine tune alerting based on the findings.
